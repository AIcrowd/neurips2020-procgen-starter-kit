# NeurIPS 2020 - Procgen Starter Kit
![AIcrowd-Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AIcrowd/AIcrowd/master/app/assets/images/misc/aicrowd-horizontal.png)

This is the starter kit for the [NeurIPS 2020 - Procgen competition](LINK-TO-BE-INSERTED) hosted on [AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/)

# About ProcGen Benchmark

16 simple-to-use procedurally-generated [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environments which provide a direct measure of how quickly a reinforcement learning agent learns generalizable skills.  The environments run at high speed (thousands of steps per second) on a single core.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/procgen/master/screenshots/procgen.gif)

These environments are associated with the paper [Leveraging Procedural Generation to Benchmark Reinforcement Learning](https://cdn.openai.com/procgen.pdf) [(citation)](#citation). Compared to [Gym Retro](https://github.com/openai/retro), these environments are:

* Faster: Gym Retro environments are already fast, but Procgen environments can run >4x faster.
* Non-deterministic: Gym Retro environments are always the same, so you can memorize a sequence of actions that will get the highest reward.  Procgen environments are randomized so this is not possible.
* Customizable: If you install from source, you can perform experiments where you change the environments, or build your own environments.  The environment-specific code for each environment is often less than 300 lines.  This is almost impossible with Gym Retro.

# System Requirements

* Supported platforms:
  - Windows 10
  - macOS 10.14 (Mojave), 10.15 (Catalina)
  - Linux (manylinux2010)

* Supported Pythons:
  - 3.6 64-bit
  - 3.7 64-bit

* Supported CPUs:
  - Must have at least AVX

Please refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/AIcrowd/neurips2020-procgen-starter-kit/blob/master/docs/running.md) for advanced users.

## How do I add a custom Model ?
To add a custom model, create a file inside `models/` directory and name it `models/my_vision_network.py`.
Please refer [here](https://github.com/AIcrowd/neurips2020-procgen-starter-kit/blob/master/models/my_vision_network.py ) for a working implementation of how to add a custom model. You can then set the `custom_model` field in the experiment yaml to `my_vision_network` to cause that model to be used.

## How do I add a custom Algorithm/Trainable/Agent ?
Please refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/AIcrowd/neurips2020-procgen-starter-kit/blob/master/experiments/procgen-starter-example.yaml#L4)

## What configs parameters do I have available ?
This is a very thin wrapper over RLLib. Hence, you have all the RLLib config options available in the experiment configuration (YAML) file to play with.
Please refer to [this example](https://github.com/AIcrowd/neurips2020-procgen-starter-kit/blob/master/experiments/procgen-starter-example.yaml) for an explanation on the structure and available options in the experiment config file.

## How will my code be evaluated ?
TODO - Mohanty to elaborate later

## `aicrowd.json`
Your repository should have an aicrowd.json file with following fields:

```json
{
    "challenge_id" : "evaluations-api-neurips-2020-procgen",
    "grader_id": "evaluations-api-neurips-2020-procgen",
    "evaluations_api_grader_id" : "46",
    "authors" : ["aicrowd-bot"],
    "description" : "NeurIPS 2020: Procgen Competition Agent",
    "docker_build" : false
}
```

This file is used to identify your submission as a part of the NeurIPS 2020 Procgen Competition Challenge. You must use the `challenge_id`, `grader_id`, and `evaluations_api_grader_id` specified above in the submission.

## Submission environment configuration
By default we will run your code in an Ubuntu 18.04 environment with tensorflow, pytorch, mlflow, ray[rllib] and procgen installed.

If you want to run your submissions in a customized environment, first head to `aicrowd.json` and set `docker_build` to `true`. This flag tells that you need a custom environment.

You can specify your software environment by using `Dockerfile`, `environment.yml`, `requirements.txt`, `apt.txt`. Available options are

- `requirements.txt`: We will use `pip install -r requiremens.txt` to install your packages.
- `environment.yml`: We will use `conda` to install the packages in your environment.
- `apt.txt`: We will install the packages in `apt.txt` before conda/pip installations.
- `Dockerfile`: We will build the docker image using the specified Dockerfile. **If you have a Dockerfile in your repository, any other automatic installation will not be triggered.** This means that you will have to include installation steps for `apt.txt`, `requirements.txt`, and `environment.txt` yourself.

A sample [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) and a corresponding [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) are provided in this repository for you reference.


## Code entrypoint
The evaluator will use `/home/aicrowd/run.sh` as the entrypoint. Please remember to have a `run.sh` at the root which can instantiate any necessary environment variables and execute your code. This repository includes a sample `run.sh` file.

## Submitting
Before making submission, you need to have your git setup done and add SSH key on AIcrowd GitLab.
You can create a submission by pushing a tag to your repository with a prefix `submission-`. An example is shown below (you can keep repository name as you desire or have multiple repositories):

```bash

# Optional: Start working with starter kit as starting point.
git clone https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/aicrowd/neurips-2020-procgen-starter-kit
cd neurips-2020-procgen-starter-kit

# Add AICrowd git remote endpoint
git remote add aicrowd git@gitlab.aicrowd.com:<user>/neurips-2020-procgen-starter-kit.git
git push aicrowd master

# Create a tag for your submission and push
git tag -am "submission-v0.1" submission-v0.1
git push aicrowd master
git push aicrowd submission-v0.1

# Note : If the contents of your repository (latest commit hash) does not change, 
# then pushing a new tag will not trigger a new evaluation.
```

You should now be able to see the details of your submission in the repository's issues page.

Happy Submitting!! :rocket:

## Locally running the code
You can run the code by executing `run.sh` file in the repository.

```bash
cd <repository>
./debug.sh
```
